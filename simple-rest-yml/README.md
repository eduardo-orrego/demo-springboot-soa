## Spring Boot Project Demo - Simple REST Service with H2 Database - Configured with application.yml
#### The application configuration will be defined in the application.yml file, as detailed below:
```    
server:
    port: 8082

spring:
    application:
    name: simple-rest-yml

datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb   
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: password

jpa:
    show-sql: true

logging:
    level:
        org.hibernate.SQL: DEBUG
```
#### The configuration system used by Spring Boot to define the application's behavior is based on properties organized in a hierarchical format using YAML. In this format, properties are structured using indentation, allowing for clear and concise configuration of various aspects of the application. For example, the server property includes the port key, which specifies the port on which the embedded server (such as Tomcat or Jetty) will listen for incoming HTTP requests..
#### Below is a brief description of each property.
| Property Name                             | Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
