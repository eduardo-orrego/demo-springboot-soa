## Spring Boot Project Demo - Simple REST Service with H2 Database - Configured with application.properties
#### The application configuration will be defined in the application.properties file, as detailed below:
    ```
    server.port=8081
    spring.application.name=simple-rest-prop
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=sa
    spring.datasource.password=password
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
    ```
#### The configuration system used by Spring Boot to define the behavior of the application is based on properties, which are key-value pairs that configure various aspects of the application. For example, the property key server.port specifies the configuration option that Spring Boot will use to determine the port on which the embedded server (such as Tomcat or Jetty) will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
#### Below is a brief description of each property.
| Property Name  | Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
